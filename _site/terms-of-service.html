<p>Business information provided to WA.business can only be used in effort to help your business. None of the data we collect from businesses can be sold, shared, or used for any other purpose.</p>

<p>We are not a largely staffed, 24 hour operation. This is a voluntary effort conducted by two people. It is our goal to serve as many local businesses as we can, but this site may not be capable of providing a space for every single business that comes to us.</p>

<p>This is an unregistered charity. All of the work done for WA.business is voluntary and therefore unpaid. Any donations or profits collected by WA.business go to server costs or running ads for small businesses.</p>
