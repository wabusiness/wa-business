I"≈<h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>

<p>In these Terms of Service, ‚Äúsmall businesses‚Äù, will be used to refer to businesses that we choose to support. These businesses can be chosen at our own discretion. (We try to choose businesses that are within Washington State and are small in size.)</p>

<p>WA.business only supports small businesses.</p>

<p>Information provided to WA.business will be publicly available. None of the data we collect from businesses will be sold to 3rd parties.</p>

<p>We are not a largely staffed, 24 hour operation. This is a voluntary effort conducted by two people. This site may not be capable of providing a space for every single small business that comes to us.</p>

<p>This is an unregistered charity. All of the work done by WA.business is voluntary and therefore unpaid. Any funding‚Äîincluding, but not limited to, donations and merchandise sales‚Äîgoes to server costs or running ads for small businesses.</p>
