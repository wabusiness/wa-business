I"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for many small businesses in Washington, which are the cornerstone of our local economy. They often operate on razor-thin margins, and business owners don’t always have a safety net. With the streets becoming a ghost town, and many restaurants having sit-down dining banned, paying customers are hard to come by for any type of small business. But people are flocking in droves to larger stores, increasing their chances of spreading the virus. Why not spread out more by shopping small?</p>
