  # Terms of Service


  Business information provided to WA.business can only be used in effort to
  help your business. None of the data we collect from businesses can be sold,
  shared, or used for any other purpose.


  We are not a largely staffed, 24 hour operation. This is a voluntary effort
  conducted by two people. It is our goal to serve as many local businesses as
  we can, but this site may not be capable of providing a space for every single
  business that comes to us.


  This is an unregistered charity. All of the work done for WA.business is
  voluntary and therefore unpaid. Any donations or profits collected by
  WA.business go to server costs or running ads for small businesses.
